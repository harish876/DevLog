This is a project template for Agentic Coding with [Pocket Flow](https://github.com/The-Pocket/PocketFlow), a 100-line LLM framework, and your editor of choice.

- We have included the [.cursorrules](.cursorrules), [.clinerules](.clinerules), and [.windsurfrules](.windsurfrules) files to let Cursor AI (also Cline, or Windsurf) help you build LLM projects.

Any personal notes or anecdotes? (optional): This project was really groundbreaking because this was the first time i had built an utility tool of this magnitude from scratch. I was sick of writing javascript and thats when i discovered HTMX and Go. I felt templ was a great JSX like templating language and i just really loved the way i could design websites using Go. I loved every bit of it from implementing file based routing to building my own small component library which i am semi proud of, but even super stoked to have built something which i was very passionate about.
